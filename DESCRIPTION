Description: mlmi implements so called Maximum Likelihood Multiple Imputation as described by von Hippel (2018) <arXiv:1210.0870v9>. A number of different imputations are available, by utilising the norm, cat and mix packages. Inferences can be performed either using combination rules similar to Rubin's or using a likelihood score based approach based on theory by Wang N and Robins JM (1998) <doi:10.1093/biomet/85.4.935>.
